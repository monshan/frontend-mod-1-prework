## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I have used the Pomodoro technique in a casual setting before and to be transparent did not much much luck with it. It has been a challenge but quite a novel challenge to use it in the interest of learning a skill and I hope to continue to practice using it in the future.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

My typical workflow without the Pomodoro technique is usually long bursts of deep-work or deep-concentration that is actually quite hard to break out of for me and its usually only interrupted either by lunch or a meeting whichever comes first. The experience of using Pomodoro was more useful in the sense that my bad eyes experience eye strain intensely by the end of the day and the tension in my back and neck are more easily resolved when I take consistent breaks to get up out of my seat and stretch. There is also a subtle sense of being refreshed at the beginning of each session.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

Unlike an array, objects can hold several properties and key-value pairs or rather they can be recorded with much more detail and precision than simple arrays. An array has its place in the case that simple lists are needed and can even represent a collection of instances, however when such a list along with its values, descriptions, and etc. are needed to best represent an instance or collection of instances (a class) developers can turn to objects.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class

It depends, if all we want out of this list are the students name, number, identifier, etc. then an array would be acceptable. If we need to store more than one value per student/instance such as their name, age, student number, emergency contact and others then an object would be more suitable.

  * List of states and their capitals

An object would be best as each specific state has a specific capitol which directly translates to a key-value pair.

  * List of things to pack for vacation

It depends, if all items might be considered a boolean data type to represent 'packed' or 'not packed' then an array might be appropriate as these individual elements can be further managed by the body of the code. However, if there are more detailed values in addition to the boolean that must be considered such as quantity, charged or not, storage location and etc. then storing in an objcet would be more suitable.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow

It depends, if its just the account name than an array is sufficient. If account name, total followers, profile image, and others are necessary then an object would be more suitable.

  * List of student names and their cohort

Referencing my answer to the 'list of all students' question above, this would be best stored in an object at student name and their cohort can be considered a key-value pair.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake

An object is best in this case as ingredients and amount can be considered a key-value pair.

  * All my favorite restaurants

An array might be best in this case as it does not look like anything other than the name of the restaurant necessarily needs to be recorded.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

In recent years the term 'cloud computing' has been gaining a lot of traction I think both within the coding community and to the general layman due to the general convenience of having access to files across devices. This has also escalated to not only files but whole apps and functionalities and exist exclusively on the cloud, an example being Amazon Alexa skills, Siri, and Google Assistant. Some objects that they interact with similar to the 'transaction item object' might be the Amazon shopping cart, to-do list, and spotify/apple playlists.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

Likely this is not a bridge we will come to for some time but I do wonder how objects are held in databases and how algorithms are designed about such objects to either optimize object elements or behave relative to other objects.
