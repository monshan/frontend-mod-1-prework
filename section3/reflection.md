## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Though I had internally developed a similar understanding about problem-solving before, I had not heard of the term 'Zone of Proximal Development' before reading the first blog post. It is refreshing to know that this phenomenon has at least some colloquial backing and further confirm that this zone can be expanded and further refined. Though one might predict that the process focus is important for all roles, I would agree that it is particularly salient to coding and development as its core pillars are supported by ones deep understanding of the system, how to make, break, and essentially dance with the code.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I've been a proponent of the 'you can learn anything with time and practice' train for a long time now but do find it shaken every once in awhile. Though up through this point I have enjoyed coding and its seemingly endless potential I would be lying if I said I don't estimate struggling and getting frustrated through the Turing Program. I think my biggest pitfall around the Growth Mindset is its combination with the theory of multiple intelligences, though anyone *can* doesn't mean everyone can do it *well* and *excel* in any given skill on earth. Admittedly I have short patience with people that don't keep pace when something is on the line, and it will be a practice in patience to embrace this fact for both others and with the expectations around my own work.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I currently work in E-commerce and I can see a clear use of arrays in product listings, category pages and etc. especially in the Shopify powered small-business solutions. There is a clear and limited collection of products that must be shown on their applicable pages in which the categories and pages are representative of the array and the product listings are the array elements.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is simply a tool or a vehicle in which to change an array. There is a variety of potential functions which can all be represented with an array method, or if in a more complex manner can be a combination of methods in an original function.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

There will be instances when developers want to run the same function or method over multiple instances or a range of instances. In the case of an array, it is this running (iteration) across the array elements. If the goal is to iterate across either an array or a portion of an array then of course you can combine loops with an array, and otherwise loops can also be used independently if you wanted to iterate over the same originating instance multiple times or however many times set.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

You want to ride your bike around the neighborhood for example, you could ride it around this cul-de-sac once and that is one iteration. For each ride you might pass by the same people or many different people. You could also ride around multiple cul-de-sacs and have a similar situation and see the same or different people. But the point is each time you ride your bike around a cul-de-sac that is one instance until you become tired and go home, which would be the end of the loop.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

When talking about loops, the topic of an 'infinite loop' often comes up but usually its in aversion to encountering one and in suggestion that developers be wary of writing them unintentionally. I have a small bit of curiosity of infinite loops and if there is any application that would benefit from infinite loops.
