//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals.push("Gorilla")
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that willadd a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.splice(3, 0, "Lion")
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
console.log(animals[2]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ['curry', 'chicken noodle soup', 'pulled pork', 'jolloff rice']

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push('broccoli')
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
 var removeLast = foods.pop()
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
foods.push('sushi', 'malatang', 'bibimbap')
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
var removeFirst = foods.shift()
console.log(foods);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: TikTok - Your profile page is an array of your authored (filmed) short form videos
// 2: Pinterest - you might have multiple boards with multiple pins in each so both your overall profile and any of your boards are likely arrays
// 3: Twitter - Tweets can both be independent in a 'feed' or act as a thread, and in the case of threads it likely becomes an array type with the building replies and retweets that follow

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  // The most overarching question of this situation is if 15% or more of battery is left, so I've written it as the first conditional
  console.log('User can call an Uber');
} else if (hasCharger == true && chargerType == "car") {
  // If there is not enough battery, both having a charger and that it is a car charger are necessary so we can write the logical operator && for both conditionals
  console.log('User can call an Uber');
} else {
  // In all other/remaining cases the user cannot call an uber so I've written it as the last else here to log to the console
  console.log("User cannot call an Uber");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
