## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

For a long time, and to a point that I felt I was one of few that believed in it, I have been an advocate for self-learning and improvement. Education is not something that ends when the government deems it enough, how we grow as individuals in the seemingly infinite branches and aspects of what we can do calls for a lifetime's worth of curiosity. Though I enjoyed reading when I was younger the daily stresses have taken away that genuine interest over time, I hope I can take a new perspective and read more often. If I were to chose one that I need to take more intentional action to incorporate in my life it is to make a point to share knowledge and teachings with others. Gate-keeping is a more modern take on this greed and right to knowledge which is in many cases problematic, so I hope that more efforts in that respect will make me a better 'Super Learner'.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

In section 1 we took a closer look at three data types, strings, numbers (integers), and booleans. String data consists of the written word, though at some points numbers may be involved or included the entirity or nature of string data is that it is a phrase or sentence of English to convey meaning. Numbers or integers are more direct, simply that they are numerical values that are usually put to some use by maths or for the sake of calculations. Boolean data returns only true or false, perhaps the most absolute of the three, it is used only for the distinction between these true or false states.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
'''
console.log("Hello World!")
'''
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
'''
//
'''

The purpose of code comment is to explain subtleties of the code in plain English in the case that simply showing the raw code would not be enough to convey the full or necessary meaning for others who might be reading it. The structural reasoning is not always clear by simply reading the code and so code comment exists for the sake of developers and others to understand the human thought process behind it.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is simply a container for something that might change. Take for example a cup, it can hold several different types of liquid such as water, juice, or tea but it does not change the fact that it is a cup and it can hold some form of liquid or beverage in it

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Tiktok for example, uses several elements or trackers if you will of your user behavior on the app to best construct the 'for you' page. Simple things like your profile will have variables such as username (string), accounts following, number of followers, likes (integers), and online symbol (boolean).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is taking the information stored in variables and placing them in some combined form. In the section 1 example we printed a string containing many variables into one log to the console, however concatenation may also combine or reference any and multiple data types of variables into one result.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

A simple example might be the screentime widget that apple ios users might be familiar with on mobile, by tracking the amount of time you spend on screen and on what apps your tailored daily/weekly screentime report will require concatenation to deliver timely and accurate reports depending on your behavior on mobile any particular day.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Because I've spent some time self-learning, especially in the case of JavaScript, I am wondering how these three data types can be combined with more original functions to the point of user-readiness that we see on the web. I'm sure we will dive into it at a later point, but having a strong grasp and understanding of the foundations does beget curiosity around to what point can it be pushed to achieve marketability.
